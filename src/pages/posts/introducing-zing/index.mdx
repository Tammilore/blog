In today's fast-changing digital world, getting financial data in Africa can be difficult. The old-school banks aren't great at sharing their data plus implementing their APIs can be pretty rough for developers. Additionally, current providers have their major focus on bank account data and once they provide you with that data, you’re pretty much on your own in figuring out how to analyze it. Usually, this equates to having to pair up 2-3 additional APIs for your perfect solution. Sucks, doesn’t it?
