At Mintlify, we work day-in and day-out with brilliant engineers, product leaders, and technical writers to build world-class documentation.

While an amazing documentation experience design is important, we believe that well-thought content organization, readability, and accessibility are equally paramount to successful docs. Unfortunately, many of our users tell us about the difficulty of creating phenomenal content.

That’s why today, we’re launching **Suggestions**: a new feature available on [Mintlify’s dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) that provides helpful recommendations on how to improve your documentation.

## Our new tool provides recommendations in three main areas:

### Structure and Readability

We scan the general layout and design of your documentation— **Suggestions** will then provide advice to improve readability. This includes changing header structure, introducing new custom components, and reorganizing text.

### Grammar and Spelling

We look for grammatical or spelling errors as well as offer insight into potential sentence structure changes to increase the literacy of the documentation to everyday users.

### Links and Accessibility

Broken links can be frustrating for users, as redirects to other parts of the documentation aren’t correctly tied. **Suggestions** assesses the functionality of all embedded links and the overall accessibility of the document.

**This is just the start and there are many more reocmmendation areas coming soon!**

## How did we build it?

**Suggestions** is currently powered by [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) and prompt-engineered from our experience working with exceptional documentation. It’s built to be consistently reliable and high quality.
