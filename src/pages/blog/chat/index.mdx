Today, we're excited to announce that Mintlify Chat, our intelligent answer discovery experience, is officially out of private beta and available to all [startup plan](/pricing) documentation.

Imagine [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), but trained on your own content and tailored to be a helpful assistant for your documentation.

Want to try it out for yourself? Go to [mintlify.com/docs](https://mintlify.com/docs), hit `cmd` + `K`, and type in a question.

## Why we built it

Mintlify has always taken a problem-first approach to building and launching products. When users click on the search box, they want answers - not a list of 10 pages that _might_ contain what they're looking for.

Since ChatGPT came out, we've wondered how we could deliver answers directly and in a conversation manner. After all, no one _loves_ the traditional search experience that we're so used to seeing in documentation.

For a long time, we were troubled by the quality and reliability of the answers. LLMs are prone to [hallucinations](https://towardsdatascience.com/llm-hallucinations-ec831dcd7786), and for documentation (the place viewers go to find the correct answer), frequent hallucinations are not good enough.

### What changed?

[GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) raised the bar significantly on question and answer use cases. While GPT-3.5 would score in the bottom 10% of LSAT test takers, GPT-4 would score in the top 10%.

In our own tests, we also saw dramatic improvements on the quality of answers that helped us confide in the reliability of responses.

Here's an example running on [Flatfile's documentation](https://flatfile.com/docs).
