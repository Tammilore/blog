We're excited to announce that **Mintlify Chat** - our intelligent answer discovery experience - is officially out of private beta and available to all [startup plan](/pricing) customers.

Mintlify Chat is built using [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), trained on your own documentation and tailored to be a helpful assistant for your users.

Want to try it out for yourself? Go to [mintlify.com/docs](https://mintlify.com/docs), hit `cmd` + `K`, and type in a question.

## Why we built it

We at Mintlify have always taken a problem-first approach to building products. When users click on the search box, we believe that they want answers, not a list of 10 pages that _might_ contain what they're looking for. As obvious as that sounds, conventional documentation wisdom thinks differently.

Since ChatGPT came out, we've wondered how we could improve discoverability within documentation. After all, no one _loves_ the traditional search experience that we're so used to seeing in documentation.

For a long time, we were troubled by the quality and reliability of the answers. LLMs are prone to [hallucinations](https://towardsdatascience.com/llm-hallucinations-ec831dcd7786), and the quality did not suffice.

### What changed?

[GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) raised the bar significantly on question and answer use cases. While GPT-3.5 would score in the bottom 10% of LSAT test takers, GPT-4 would score in the top 10%.

In our own tests, we also saw dramatic improvements on the quality of answers that helped us confide in the reliability of responses.

Here's an example running on [Flatfile's documentation](https://flatfile.com/docs).

## Building with Inkeep

We're excited to announce that we are launching Mintlify Chat in collaboration with our friends at [Inkeep](https://inkeep.com). With Inkeep, building the chat system meant just adding in a few API requests to our product.

The fine-tuning of the results, optimizations, and quality control has been thoughtfully crafted, ensuring that our end users are able to easily get the best answers for their questions.
